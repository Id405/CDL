# Who Are We?

Climate Defense League is a student organization located at West Valley High School promoting climate sustainability, awareness, and action. We believe that it's never too little or too late to save the environment, and that everyone can make a difference.

# Projects

## Recycling

The Recycling committee is a group of CDL members who are dedicated to establishing a recycling program inside local schools. Currently, they are working with West Valley High School to set up paper recycling bins in every classroom. They are responsible for the management of these bins by taking them out weekly to the recycling center. Their future goal is to establish a uniform and lasting recycling program throughout all Fairbanks schools.

## Outreach

CDL Public Outreach is committed to educating students and the public about local and global climate change and what actions they can take to make an impact as well as connecting CDL to the community. Public outreach is currently working on setting up an educational billboard at West Valley to announce current CDL projects, post information, and encourage students to do their part for their climate. Future goals include writing letters to local and national leaders expressing West Valley students' support and encouraging leaders to push for climate action. 

# Get Involved!
